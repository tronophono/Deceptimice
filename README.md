# Furios7-Micromouse
Repository that will keep all the notes and code for the making of the <i><u>Deceptimice</u></i> micro mouse

<h3> Libraries </h3>
The main Libraries for this project is under <i>Furios7-Libraries</i>
This is the code that we are using so far, the other folders are obsolete for now.

<h3>Main Program</h3>
The main program that will use these libraries is <b>Deceptimice_MOUSE.ino</b>
A .ino file is what the arduino ide sees as a main file, we can replace it with .cpp and itll still work
as long as you have arduino.h as one of your include.

<h3>Log</h3>

The <b>Maze</b> folder under <i>Furios7-Libraries</i> is still being worked on. So far it only has some header
files that have a struct inside of them which will be used to store cordinates and instructions.


<h3>FAQ</h3>
<b><i>Why do you not erase the obsolete folders?</i></b>

The folders are kept so you can see how we ended up with the main Library, the code will be removed eventually.

<b><i>How do you make it build?</i></b>

The easiest way is to copy and paste all the files inside the folders in the <b>Furios7-Libraries</b> in the same folder/directory where <b>Deceptimice_MOUSE.ino</b> is located at.
